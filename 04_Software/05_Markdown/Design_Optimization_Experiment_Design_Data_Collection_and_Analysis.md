### 1. Volume of segment vs velocity
 - Controlled variable: Segment length, segment height, segment width
 - Performance goal: Velocity
 - Research Questions: How does the segment design affect velocity of the system? Is there a maximum segment length that can be used with the system?
 - Code: [Segment Volume Optimization](Length_Constrained_Dynamics_Optimization_Segment_Area.md)

### 2. Constraint link length vs velocity
 - Controlled variable: Constraint link length
 - Performance goal: Velocity
 - Research Questions: How does the overall length constraint affect velocity of the system? Is there a minimum constraint that can be used with the system?
 - Code: [Constraint Link Length Optimization](./Length_Constrained_Dynamics_Opimization_Not_Optimizing.md)

### 3. Frequency and Sweep Angle  vs velocity
 - Controlled variable: frequency, sweep angle
 - Performance goal: Velocity
 - Research Questions: How does the frequency and servo angle affect velocity of the system? Is there a maximum frequency that the system can handle?.
 - Code: [Frequency Optimization](../Frequency_optimization.md)

### 4. Tail length vs velocity
 - Controlled variable: tail link length
 - Performance goal: Velocity
 - Research Questions: How does the tail design affect velocity of the system? Is there a maximum tail length that can be used with the system?
 - Code: [Tail Length Optimization](./Tail_Optimization.md)
