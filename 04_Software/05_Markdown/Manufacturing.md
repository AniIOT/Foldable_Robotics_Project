# Manufacturing

## Design and Manufacturing Workflow

#### Introduction

For manufacturing, we used a CAD model to design our final design and used a macro to convert the design into a yaml file.  After that, we used a jupyter program to add joints and create a laminate structure in a DXF file for manufacturing on a laser cutter.  From our research, we understood that we needed a stiff, waterproof material for each link and selected thin plexiglass sheets for our segment material.  However, we do not need any stiffness in the joints, so our middle sections were a flexible film.  For manufacturing, we decided to use a laser cutter to cut out the different segments held together with a heat-activated adhesive.
